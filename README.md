# Destroy-or-Defend

Destroy or Defend (DorD) is a tower defense multi-player board game. On a massive 10,000 by 10,000 
square arena, a defender aspires to protect their main base and an attacker aspires to destroy that base. 
The defender uses a combination of stationary towers (supporting turrets, cannons, sentinels and guns) 
and patrolling forces (consisting of soldiers, tanks and other vehicles) to protect its base. An attacker 
uses marching armies (consisting of soldiers, tanks and other vehicles) to attack the defender’s units, 
towers and base. Given a preset time, the attacker must complete their task by successfully destroying 
the base and win; otherwise, the defender receives backup units, destroys the attacker units and 
successfully defends the base and win. 
There are two teams in the arena, an attacking team and a defending team. Each team comprises one or 
more players. You are one of those players and must successfully destroy or defend the base, depending 
on which team you are on. The game consists of only one run. Before the beginning of the run, each 
player receives a preset number of “points” which they can use to buy and setup their defending or 
attacking units. Each unit is also given an autonomous tactic which will be followed throughout the run. 
A player is allowed to setup their units on certain regions of the arena. Once the run starts, the game 
units behave autonomously (without any intervention from the player). The units attack or defend 
following their assigned tactics. The run continues until one of the following occurs where one victor is 
declared:
• The base is destroyed, regardless of how many defending units are still alive;
• The attacker units are destroyed and no more attacking units are available; or
• The preset time is up, which means the attack has failed.
